I didn't take the photos yet but I want to create the folder to have everything ready for when I do, so anyway if you are still reading this here are the 3 laws of robotics as per Isaac Asimov's words:
A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.
A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.
A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.
